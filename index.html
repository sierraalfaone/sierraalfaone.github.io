          <p class="lead">On August 2017, I had the choice to take this further or do something else with my life. I decided to do something else, and not this, and joined forces with <a href="https://lftechnology.com" class="underline">Leapfrog Technology</a> and have since been leading the awesome design team out there.</p>

          <p>As a result, this project never kicked off really except for few shadow design projects I completed between the summer of 2016 and 2017 under the name Sierra Alfa One. That's all now a history. This page is no longer maintained and I'm not accepting any new project contracts under this name.</p>
          
          <p>Thank you for your interest in Sierra Alfa One.</p>
